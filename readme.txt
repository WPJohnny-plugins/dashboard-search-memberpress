Search for MemberPress members right from your WordPress Dashboard. Saves you a few clicks.

== Description ==

I developed this plugin to manage members easier and faster. You can now search for members very quickly from your main Dashboard page instead of having to click to the MemberPress > Members page. Also, the plugin allows you to hit your [ENTER] key to search instead of having to click the "GO" button. Whatever is entered will be searched within all fields (user, first name, last name, email, ID).

= Features: =

* Convenient searchbox from main Dashboard page.
* Can use [ENTER] key to search instead of clicking the "GO" button.
* The [ENTER] key works on both the Dashboard search and the default MemberPress > Members page.

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with the latest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works perfect with the latest version of WordPress! It also works with older versions as well but you should always run the latest WordPress and PHP version for best security and performance. This plugin is used in my critical sites so you can be assured it works perfect.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =
No. It's one tiny little 1KB javascript file that loads only on two backend pages (your main Dashboard page, and the MemberPress "Members" page). It does not load anything on the frontend or on any other page.
